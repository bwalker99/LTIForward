<h3>Invoke LTI</h3>
<p>InvokeLTI is a utility that can be used to do the heavy lifting of LTI authentication. 
It can be used as front end to a third-party Tool Provider (TP) that is written in another language
(for example .Net) that may not have strong LTI integration. </p>

<p>The premise is that the Invoke LTI procedure is called from a Tool Consumer (TC), such as an LMS. 
It creates a cookie whose value is the custom parameters that are passed in from the TC. Invoke LTI 
then forwards control to the TP. The TP must be able to read the cookie and extract the parameters that it needs to offer the service. </p>

<p>Note that the presence of the cookie is proof of authentication to the TP. The cookie lifespan should be 
set to something short: 5 - 10 seconds, enough time for the TP to read it. The cookie will need to be managed
in terms of the domain that it is valid for. The server that run Invoke LTI will probably be different
from the server that runs the TP. The assumption is that they must be in the same domain, but not the same server. 
Of course if the TP and InvokeLTI are on the same server, the domain can be left blank, otherwise it
may be need to set to something like '.myschool.edu'.      
 
<p>InvokeLTI is a java servlet delivered as a war file. It has been tested on Tomcat 7 on Windws and Linux.
All library should be included. The InvokeLTI.properties file can be edited, and servlet application restarted
to customize. </p>

<p>Possible issues/enhancements:
<ul>
<li>Cookie needs be encrypted</li>
<li>May need more parameters than are provided by the custom parameters of LTI.</li>
<li>If many parameters are needed, cookie may not be able to hold all values.</li>
<li>May still be issues with invoking appliction on different server</li>

</ul>
